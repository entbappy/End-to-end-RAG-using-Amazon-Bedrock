One of the very deleterious departures is\\nﬂooding due to the over rain.[2] According to Wikipedia in late summer 2002,\\nenormous storm downpours driven to gigantic ﬂooding in eastern India, Nepal,\\nand Bangladesh, killing over 500 individuals and clearing out millions of houses.\\nEach year in Bangladesh approximately 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 sq mi)\\n(around 18% of the country) is ﬂooded, killing over 5,000 individuals and wreck-\\ning more than 7 million homes. On the other hand, Western Sydney is now\\nthe ”greatest concern” from the worst ﬂoods in decades to have ravaged east-\\nern Australia.[3] Jonh C, Rodda et al. presented a very rational method of the\\nrainfall measurement problem. The application of science and innovation that\\npredicts the state of the environment at any given speciﬁc period is known as\\nclimate determining or weather forecasting. There are many distinctive strate-\\ngies for climate estimate and weather forecasting. But rainfall prediction is rare.\\nSome of the research has shown some classiﬁcation method to predict whether\\nit would be rain tomorrow or not. But instead of a classiﬁcation method for pre-\\ndicting rain, we need to the quantity of the rainfall in a particular place. There\\nis numerous equipment implement for foreseeing rainfall by utilizing the climate\\nconditions like temperature, humidity, weight. These conventional strategies can-\\nnot work productively so by utilizing machine learning procedures. we can create\\nan exact comes about rain forecast. Ready to fair do it by having the histori-\\ncal information investigation of rainfall and can anticipate the precipitation for\\nfuture seasons. In our paper, we presented some predictive regression analysis\\ntechniques to quantify rainfall quantity at a place. Here we used more than 10\\nyears of historical data to train our model. The dataset contains various weather\\nconditions of diﬀerent places. This method can be utilized to predict the rainfall\\n(The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm) and avoid the annihilation\\ncaused by it to life, agriculture, farm, and property. If we can quantify the rain-\\nfall most people can make some decisions before overwhelmed rain-aﬀected. The\\ncontributions of this work are summarised as:\\n–We have assessed a pipeline of making choices for evaluating the ﬁnest rea-\\nsonable rain prediction.\\n–We have utilized 10 supervised regressors (Machine Learning Model). Be-\\ncause diﬀerent regressors give us diﬀerent results. So, it’s essential to ﬁnd\\nout the right model according to the requirements.', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\my_paper.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='Rainfall Prediction 3\\n–We have discussed a big comparison among all trained models to ﬁgure out\\nthe best performer.\\nThe paper is organized as takes after: Section II clariﬁes the related work of\\ndiﬀerent classiﬁcation strategies for the forecast of rain classiﬁcation.

Within the information collection step, we have\\nused a dataset7from the Kaggle platform which has been split into two parts\\nsuch as the training part and validation part. Here we have utilized one of the\\nvalidation parts as the testing data to evaluate the models’ performance. Each\\nrow has various weights for decision making to suggest the sensible best rain\\nprediction. Afterward, gathering all raw data, ﬁrstly we would be made ready\\nfor the training model with the help of data pre-processing techniques and this\\nhas been used for outliers free and more rigid. It also assists to increase the per-\\nformance of the models. As a result, we have applied six pre-processing methods\\nsuch as cleaning data, missing value check, handling the categorical data, han-\\ndling outliers, handling outliers, feature selection. Next, to establish supervised\\nregressors models, we utilized the regressors such as Linear Regression, Ridge\\nRegression, Polynomial Regression, and Lasso Regression. From all the training\\nmethods we have used a total of 10 regressors so that we can compare the per-\\nformance and ﬁgure out the best model. Most of the regressors come up with a\\ngood performance.

We ought to preprocess the information con-\\ncurring to create it ﬁt for the machine learning model. Well-processed data gives\\nhigh accuracy and makes the model more solid. Here, we have utilized a few\\nstages of preprocessing strategies, which have been outlined in Figure-2:\\nInput DataData Cleaning\\nRemoved unused\\nfeature\\nRemoved DuplicatesHandling missing values\\nMean & MedianHandling categorical data\\nEDA\\nOne Hot Encoding\\nHandling outliersIQR\\nMethod\\nFeature ScalingStandard Scaler \\nFeature SelectionNumerical \\nCategorical Model Output\\nFig. 2. Data Pre-Processing\\nIn our dataset, there are parcels of unused, null, and duplicate values. For\\nthis reason, we took some steps to handle these issues. such as,\\n–Erased duplicate row and column: we discover that numerous information\\npoints are repeated in row and column sections. Therefore, we expelled all\\nthe duplicate information.\\n–Erased the row and column, which shows up more than 50% of the null value.\\nCleaning data occurs when 50% of information comes to the null value. At\\nthat point, we have chosen to evacuate the whole rows and columns. For\\nthe most part, missing value is characterized as the value which was not put\\naway within the sample. The missing value may be a common occasion in\\ninformation. On the other hand, most prescient modeling strategies can’t\\nhandle any missing value. Thus, this issue must be unraveled before model-\\ning. In some cases, median, mean, mode strategies are utilized to overhaul\\na missing value. In any case, the foremost direct method for managing the\\nmissing value is the mean, median, mode strategy. Here we have utilized this\\nmean, median & mode strategy for managing missing data\\n–Handled categorical features: Categorical data could be a subjective include\\nwhose values are taken on the value of labels. So, we ought to encode this\\nsort of information into numbers so that the machine learning model can', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\my_paper.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='Rainfall Prediction 7\\nexecute scientiﬁc operations on it. In our dataset, there exist a few categorical\\nfeatures. We have utilized one-hot encoding, one of the foremost prevalent\\nencoding algorithms, to encode the categorical values into numbers. It is the\\nforemost common approach, and it works well unless any categorical variable\\ntakes a large number of diverse values. After this encoding, a double matrix\\nis shaped where 1 indicates the presence of any value and 0 indicates the\\nabsence of the value.\\n–Inside our dataset, there were a lot of outliers presented: an outlier is a\\nperception point that’s removed from other perceptions. An outlier may be\\ndue to variations within the estimation or it may appear exploratory mistake\\nthe latter are some of the time excluded from the set of information. An issue\\nof outliers can cause, they tend to be unaﬀected by littler UI changes that\\ndo inﬂuence a more whimsical standard population. Bulk orders will thrust\\nthrough littler convenience changes in a way that your average visitor may\\nnot. So to handle the outliers we have used the IQR (interquartile range)\\nmethod, which is an eﬃcient technique.\\n–Include scaling is one of the signiﬁcant strategies that are mandatory to\\nstandardize the working data’s independent features. All things considered,\\nthere are diﬀerent strategies like Min-Max Scaling, Variance Scaling, Stan-\\ndardization, Mean Normalization, and Unit vectors for include scaling. In\\nour work, we have applied standard scaling as a feature scaling procedure.\\nHere, the exchanged every data point in the range of between -1 and 1.\\n3.3 Training selective Models\\nThe linear model[24]performs well in machine learning linearly. We utilized the\\nfour regressors as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Polynomial Regression,\\nand Lasso Regression. Tree-model [25]algorithms are considered to be one of the\\nleading and most utilized supervised learning methods. In this work, we utilize\\na decision tree regressor. We utilized ”gini” for the Gini impurity, and the split-\\nter is chosen as ’best’ to select the part at each node. Ensemble methods[26]\\nare procedures that make multiple models and combine them to create moves\\nforward. Here, we utilized four ensemble-based regressors. These are Random\\nForest, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost, and XGboost. Afterward, we have utilized\\nthree neighbors regressors of statistical pattern recognition. This is K- nearest\\nneighbors[27],ﬁve nearest is chosen for every iteration. Besides, the Manhat-\\ntan distance is chosen for all neighbor classiﬁers. The support vector machine\\nSVM[28] is used mainly for exploring a hyperplane in ddimensional space that\\nnotably ﬁts a hyperplane in data points. In the linear SVM, we used hinge as\\nloss function with l2 penalty.\\n4 Experiment\\nIn the advancement of our test from the proposed work, we have to begin with\\namassed the demonstrate and prepared it. 10 diﬀerent regressors from super-\\nvised learning based on distinctive learning techniques have been executed to', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\my_paper.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='8 Nusrat Jahan et al.\\nModel \\nLinear Model \\n> Linear Regression\\n> Polynomial Regression\\n> Ridge \\n> LassoTree Model \\n> Decision tree     \\n Regressor Neareﬆ Neighbor \\n> KNN Regressor Ensemble Model \\n> Random Foreﬆ\\nRegressor \\n> Adabooﬆ\\n> Gradient Booﬆing\\n> XGBooﬆ\\nSVM\\n> Support V ector \\nMachine\\nFig. 3.

At long last, sklearn library contains specialized\\nmachine learning and statistical modeling instruments, counting classiﬁcation,\\nregression, and clustering calculations for modeling. We have utilized a machine\\nlearning system named9sci-kit learn to implement the regression algorithm. At\\nlong last, we utilized10matplotlib and11seaborn for information visualization,\\ngraphical representation, additionally for information investigation.\\n8https://colab.research.google.com/\\n9https://scikit-learn.org\\n10https://matplotlib.org\\n11https://seaborn.pydata.org', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\my_paper.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='Rainfall Prediction 9\\n4.2 Statistical measurement\\nR2 score : The R2 score could be a very critical metric that’s utilized to assess the\\nperformance of a regression based machine learning model. It is articulated as\\nR squared and is additionally known as the coeﬃcient of assurance. It works by\\nmeasuring the sum of variance within the expectations clariﬁed by the dataset.\\nBasically put, it is the contrast between the tests within the dataset and the\\nexpectations made by the demonstrate. As we can see from all models Random\\nForest regressor achieves the best r2 score which is 0.869904217. The second\\nand third positions are achieved by GradientBoostingRegressor and XGBoost\\nwhich are 0.863496747 and 0.863215393. The condition is shown underneath in\\ncondition 1:\\nR2= 1−∑n\\ni=1(ˆyi−yi)2\\n∑n\\ni=1(yi−¯yi)2(1)\\nMean absolute error: If we consider with respect to error rate then ﬁrst comes\\nto mean absolute error. In measurements, mean absolute error may be a degree of\\nblunders between combined perceptions communicating the same wonder. Mean\\nAbsolute Error (MAE) is another loss function utilized for relapse models. MAE\\nis the entirety of outright contrasts between our target and anticipated factors.\\nSo it measures the normal greatness of errors in a set of forecasts, without\\nconsidering their bearings. Random Forest regressor gets the least mean absolute\\nerror rate which is 0.194459262 compare to others. The declaration of the F1\\nscore is displayed in equation 2 :\\nMAE =1\\nnn∑\\ni=1⏐⏐⏐Yi−ˆYi⏐⏐⏐ (2)\\nMean squared error: If we consider with respect to mean squared error, The\\nmean squared error (MSE) tells how near a relapse line is to a set of focuses.\\nIt does this by taking the separations from the focuses to the relapse line these\\nseparations are the errors and squaring them, we call It mean squared error.\\nFrom all the models Random forest achieves a minimum mean squared error\\n0.126358647. The articulation is shown beneath in 3 :\\nMSE =1\\nnn∑\\ni=1(\\nYi−ˆYi)2\\n(3)\\nRoot mean squared error: Now if we consider the root mean squared error,\\nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE) means the standard deviation of the residuals\\nwhich is prediction error.

After de-\\nveloping the models and testing all regressors, We can see that the Random\\nForest has predicted the best accuracy of 0.869904217 among all others, and the\\nmean absolute error is 0.194459262 which is the lowest, mean squared error is\\n0.126358647 and the root mean squared error is 0.355469615.

The primary purpose of this\\ntask is to ﬁnd out the best regression technique for the prediction of rain. For\\nthis reason, we have used a variety of regression analysis techniques that can\\nbe utilized for predicting the quantity of rainfall so that anyone can use the\\nbest predictive model in real-life applications. To perform this task, we selected\\nﬁve signiﬁcant steps, these are data collection, data prepossessing, training model\\nusing regression analysis techniques, and performance analysis. In pre-processing\\npart, we have described cleaning data, Missing value check, EDA, Handling\\noutliers, Feature selection, Feature scaling respectively. Besides, we used ten\\nsupervised regressors (machine learning models) for predicting rainfall. Among\\nall models the are gives good accuracy in our predicting regression.

Also, we have plan to use the neural network based deep hybrid approaches\\nto improve the performance. Undoubtedly, we have plans to evaluate the other\\ncountry’s data for forecasting the rain.\\nReferences\\n1. EG Ortiz-Garc´ ıa, S Salcedo-Sanz, and C Casanova-Mateo.
